_Release info: 1.8.14 available 6-Mar-2019_

Small release that:

 * Will skip `module-info.class` and class files under `META-INF` that you find in multi-release JARs, as described in
   link:https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=545033[bug 545033]. This enables some usage of AspectJ 8 operating
   on JARs containing some of these features from later Java (but where the main set of classfiles in a JAR are Java 8
   or lower). For proper treatment of Java 9 code, please use AspectJ 1.9 or later.
