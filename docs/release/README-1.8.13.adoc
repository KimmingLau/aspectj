= AspectJ 1.8.13

_Release info: 1.8.13 available 15-Nov-2017_

Small release that:

  * Dials back the performance optimizations for Spring AOP. One of them was taking things too far and has caused an
    issue link:https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-16161[SPR-16161]. This wasn't the main performance enhancement for
    Spring AOP though so the numbers are still very close to those shown in the 1.8.12 readme.

  * Includes better toleration of new JDK versions. If the versions are coming out thick and fast we need older
    AspectJs to cope when simply running on new JDKs they haven't encountered before.
